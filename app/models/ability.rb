    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
    user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    
    if user.has_role? :admin
     # an admin can do everything
      can :manage, :all
    elsif user.has_role? :user
      # an user can read everything
      can :read, :all

      can :read, [User]
    end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user 
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on. 
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
